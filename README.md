In reference documentation frequently we need to explain a concept or
convey an idea before going into details. This is similar to the way
a presentation may provide additional background.
Reference documentation however is used repeatedly so it needs to
remain focused, factual, and complete. It is not a good place for
conveying ideas that only need to be conveyed once. More importantly
conceptual information most likely ends up in side notes and overviews
where the topic is most likely not adequately covered. The problem
is only multiplied with time as new authors consider where to add
or expand on existing information.

A good solution is to create topical guides separate from reference
documentation. The purpose of this repository is to hold such topical
guides for Spring projects. The repository is shared across projects
since ideas and concepts, more so than reference documentation, tend
to apply across projects and remain valid across versions.

Consider the following guidelines:

* Cover a topic specific to Spring projects.
* Communicate big picture ideas, not low level details.
* Use code samples to convey ideas, not to accomplish a task.
* Think beyond individual projects.
* Make few assumptions about prior knowledge.
* Make it easy to follow and read in 10-15 min.
* Suited for phone or tablet with no IDE.

A good topical guide is like a Youtube intro video, a lightning talk,
or a StackOverflow thread. The tone is vivid. It speaks directly to
users to communicate concepts. The opening paragraph should identify
the motivation for the guide, why it matters and who the target
audience is.

In relation to getting started guides, readers might first check out
a topical guide to get oriented, then follow getting started guides
to accomplish specific tasks.
