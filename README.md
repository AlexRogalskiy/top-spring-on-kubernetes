In reference documentation frequently we need to explain a concept or
convey an idea before going into details. This is similar to the way
a presentation may provide additional background.
Reference documentation however is used repeatedly so it needs to
remain focused, factual, and complete. It is not a good place for
conveying ideas that only need to be conveyed once. More importantly
conceptual information most likely ends up in side notes and overviews
where the topic is most likely not adequately covered. The problem
is only multiplied with time as new writers consider where to add
or expand on existing information.

The purpose of this repository is to manage topical guides for Spring
projects. The repository is shared across projects since ideas and
topics, more so than a reference, most often apply across projects
and remain valid across versions.

Consider the following general guidelines:

* Cover a topic specific to Spring projects.
* Communicate big picture ideas, not low level details.
* Use code samples to convey ideas, not to accomplish a task.
* Think beyond individual projects.
* Make few assumptions about prior knowledge.
* Identify target audience as beginner, intermediate, or advanced.
* Easy to follow and can be read in 10-15 min.
* Does not require an IDE.

A good topical guide is like a Youtube intro video, a lightning talk,
or a StackOverflow thread. The tone is vivid. It speaks directly to
users and communicates concepts. 

In relation to getting started guides, readers might first check out
a topical guide to get oriented, then follow getting started guides
to accomplish specific tasks.
